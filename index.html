        <h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>
          The most common use of JavaScript is in web pages. These scripts are
          usually used to provide interaction by responding to events,
          validating data entered in forms, or creating complex visual effects.
          JavaScript scripts executed by web pages have limited access to the
          user's computer. On the server side, JavaScript can run in the form of
          node.js or Ringo[6].
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript can also be used to write full-fledged applications. The
          Mozilla Foundation provides an environment consisting of technologies
          such as XUL, XBL, XPCOM, and JSLib. They allow the creation of
          applications that use system resources and have a graphical user
          interface tailored to the platform. An example of an application
          written using JS and XUL is the ChatZilla IRC client, which is
          included by default in the Mozilla package. Microsoft provides
          libraries for creating JScript applications as part of the Windows
          Scripting Host environment. Additionally, JScript.NET is one of the
          basic languages of the .NET environment. IBM has also created the
          SashXB environment for Linux, which allows the creation of GTK+,
          GNOME, and OpenLDAP applications using JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h2 id="History">History</h2>
        <p>
          In 1996, the ECMA organization began work on a JavaScript
          specification without references to the environment interpreting the
          code. The language described in the ECMA-262 standard was named
          ECMAScript. From that moment on, the name JavaScript only refers to
          one of the subsets of the ECMAScript language. The first version of
          the standard was similar to JavaScript version 1.1. The third version
          was the first to extend existing implementations.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Dialects">Dialects</h3>
        <p>
          Since the creation of JavaScript, various interpretations of it have
          been developed using separate engines. In addition to implementations
          introduced into web browsers, there is ActionScript for Adobe Flash
          applications and UnityScript in the Unity engine (no longer supported
          since version 2018.2[12]).
        </p>
        <h3 id="Java">Java</h3>
        <p>
          Initially, Netscape named the new language LiveScript. However, the
          name was quickly changed to JavaScript due to business agreements
          between Netscape and Sun Microsystems (co-owner of the JavaScript
          trademark is Oracle Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in
          2010). JavaScript scripts and Java applets (despite the distinctness
          of these two languages) can communicate with each other thanks to the
          available technology LiveConnect in Netscape, Mozilla, and Opera
          browsers.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Interaction">Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          All JavaScript implementations available in web browsers provide
          objects representing the document tree. They can also allow the
          creation of cookies, manipulation of browser windows, display of
          simple dialog boxes, retrieval of browser information, management of
          its plugins, and style sheets. They also respond to events triggered
          in the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          While manipulating the contents of the document, the lack of a
          standardized model posed a problem. In the fourth generation of
          browsers, access to certain document elements in Netscape was possible
          using the document.layers collection, while in Internet Explorer –
          document.all. However, the W3C organization developed a unified object
          model supported by all modern browsers (including Opera from version
          6, Konqueror from version 3, and Safari). The all and layers arrays
          were considered obsolete, and support for them was practically
          withdrawn.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Embedding">Embedding</h3>
        <p>
          In HTML, the &lt;script> element is responsible for placing JS
          scripts, with optional type arguments with values text/javascript and
          language with a value of javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the code is in an XHTML document, to prevent the interpretation of
          some operators as syntax elements of the language, the script should
          be enclosed in a CDATA section or written in entity form[14]. In
          XHTML, the language argument cannot be used to specify the version of
          the JS language (if used, the attribute should take two-letter values
          described by the ISO 639 standard, e.g., EN, DE, PL).
        </p>
        <p>
          External scripts are also added using the above tag, considering only
          the src parameter with the name of the file containing the script
          code. The MIME type for standalone JavaScript files is
          application/javascript or the deprecated text/javascript[15].
